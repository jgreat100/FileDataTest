# FileDataTest

I believe the functionality is as asked for but unfortunately I ran out of time sorting out the DI / testing side of things. I've created what I think are all the tests required to test the code, but my attempts to mock the dependency started to get a bit long winded so I thought I'd leave it like this as at least the intention is clear. Apologies if DI / mocking wasn't especially required but it feels wrong to write any code that doesn't use it!
